# Updated NPM Tab Completion

Enables tab completion for npm commands.

An updated verion of [NPMTabCompletion](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/NPMTabCompletion).

Updated to use the Register-ArgumentCompleter command from PowerShell v5 instead of depending on [TabExpansionPlusPlus](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/TabExpansionPlusPlus).

## Attribution

I would like to thank Doug Finke for his hard work in building the [NPMTabCompletion](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/NPMTabCompletion) module.
